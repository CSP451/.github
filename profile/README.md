# Welcome to the CSP451 - CSP451 Computer Systems Project Course!

## Course Description:

This course is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in designing, implementing, and deploying computer systems projects in Cloud platforms. Through a combination of tutorials, practical exercises, and real-world case studies, you will gain proficiency in leveraging cloud services for building scalable, reliable, and secure computer systems.

This is a project-based course that provides an opportunity for you to apply the knowledge you have acquired in all of the subjects in the previous semesters in multiple real-world projects focusing on the issues and considerations related to the interconnectivity and administration of various IT services in a cloud environment. You learn to identify, isolate, and solve problems that cloud architects and developers deal with in the real world. By the end of this course, you will be able to design, provision, troubleshoot and maintain virtual infrastructure.


## Key Topics Covered:

- Introduction to Azure Cloud: Overview of Azure services, regions, and deployment models.
- Cloud Computing Fundamentals: Understanding cloud computing models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), elasticity, scalability, and resource provisioning.
- Azure Infrastructure: Virtual machines, storage options, networking fundamentals, and virtual networks.
- Azure Platform Services: Introduction to Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB, and other platform-as-a-service offerings.
- DevOps Practices in Azure: Continuous integration, continuous deployment (CI/CD), and automated testing using Azure DevOps.
- Monitoring and Logging: Utilizing Azure Monitor, Azure Log Analytics, and Application Insights for performance monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Security and Compliance: Implementing security best practices, identity and access management, data encryption, and compliance standards in Azure.
- Scalability and High Availability: Designing resilient architectures using Azure Availability Sets, Availability Zones, and Azure Load Balancer.
Cost Management: Optimizing costs by understanding Azure pricing models, cost management tools, and resource utilization.
Project Implementation: Guided project work involving the design, implementation, and deployment of a computer systems project on the Azure Cloud platform.

## Learning Objectives:

- Gain a better understanding of cloud computing principles and services.
- Design and implement reliable, robust, and secure computer systems projects in the cloud environment.
- Apply basic DevOps practices for automating software delivery and deployment pipelines.
- Utilize monitoring and logging tools to ensure the performance and availability of infrastructure and service in the cloud environment.
- Optimize costs by effectively managing cloud resources and understanding pricing models.

## What you need to know

This is a project-based course that is designed to prepare you for your future careers by offering a dynamic and immersive learning experience. This course provides you with opportunities to apply theoretical knowledge gained throughout your academic journey to real-world scenarios, fostering critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and creativity. By working on authentic projects, you gain hands-on experience in navigating complexities, collaborating with other students to solve problems, and managing project timelinesâ€”skills highly sought after by employers in various industries. 

This course does not follow the regimented course-work addendum where you are frequently tested by quizzes, tests and exams, instead, you will be assigned challenging assignments that you need to research, analyze, and complete often requiring innovative solutions to unforeseeable challenges, thus enhancing your ability to adapt to the dynamics of the continuously evolving cloud computing industry. You will learn to stay abreast of emerging trends. The culmination of project-based assignments, throughout the course, will ultimately equip you with the confidence, competence, and practical expertise necessary to excel in your chosen career paths beyond the classroom.

There are no **formal teaching** sessions in this course. You are expected to explore and learn by completing assignments and coursework. During tutorials and classes, you will receive some hands-on examples of the challenging topics, however, be prepared to address the challenges yourself. You will be expected to complete most of the work individually, but at times for more complex projects you might be asked to work in a team, so be prepared to collaborate with your fellow students. 

## Who should not take this course

If a student is not ready to take on the challenges of real-world projects, it may be advisable for them not to enroll in this course. Real-world projects demand a high level of commitment, problem-solving skills, and the ability to work effectively under pressure. Without these essential attributes, students may struggle to meet the course requirements and derive meaningful learning outcomes. Moreover, participating in a course with project-based assignments requires students to actively engage in hands-on activities, collaborate with peers, and demonstrate initiative in tackling complex tasks. If a student feels unprepared or lacks the necessary skills and mindset to thrive in such an environment, it might be more beneficial for them to focus on building foundational knowledge and practical skills through prerequisite courses or additional training before attempting a course with real-world project components. Ultimately, taking on challenges beyond one's current capabilities can lead to frustration and may impede overall academic and personal development. Therefore, it's important for students to assess their readiness and choose courses that align with their current skill level and learning objectives.


This course also introduces networking design topics, including the development of a scalable and redundant network design in conjunction with disaster recovery planning. 


Whenever there is publicly available learning material for your better understanding, it will be posted in Class Recording & Material. Keep monitoring it for updates.

You are expected to have a preliminary understanding of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and have at least completed one basic project in a cloud environment. If you have never created a virtual machine before or are not comfortable with working with Linux commands, you need to do extra work to catch up.

You are also expected to be proficient in remotely creating, administering and diagnosing an interconnected multi-server environment. 




### Prerequisites

1. Basic knowledge of computer systems and networking.
2. Basic knowledge of computer networking concepts, including IP addressing, subnetting, and routing.
3. Familiarity with cloud computing fundamentals and Azure services is recommended but not mandatory.

This course is ideal for students pursuing a career in computer science, information technology, or cloud computing. It is also beneficial if you are looking to enhance your expertise in cloud networking and Azure technologies. Through this course, you can enhance your skills in cloud computing and Azure services and prepare yourself for Associate and Professional level certifications.
